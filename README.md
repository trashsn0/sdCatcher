# sdCatcher - Automate your SD cards file management

sdCatcher is a cross-platform, opensource software aiming to solve the *repetitive*, *time-consuming* and often *forgettable* task of **copying** medias from a SD card to one's **external-drive/computer**.
 

## Simplicity


sdCatcher is *lightweight* and very simple by design.
The only necessary configuration from the user are the **Mappings**.

### How to install 
TBD

### Mappings

Mappings consist of choosing :
- a **media type** (Video/Pictures currently supported)
- a **source directory** (from the SD card)
- a **destination directory** (on computer/external-drive)
- one or multiple **file format** (.jpg,.mp4,.mov ...)

Once your mapping is created, you are good to go !
Whenever you will plug your SD card, you will get prompted with a dialog allowing you to automatically apply the mappings present on this card.

Of course, you can have **multiple mappings** at the same time on one or more SD card(s)

### Graphical User Interface

To make the Mapping process even more simple, sdCatcher provides a *beautifull* GUI

## Cross-Platform

sdCatcher aims to work on all devices and platform.
As of right now, it is currently tested and supported on :
- Linux ❌
- Mac OS ✅
- Windows ❌
- Ipad OS ❌
- IOS ❌
- Android ❌
- Chrome OS ❌


## Limitations

> Everytime a volume disk is detected, if a mapping for that volume exist, sdCatcher will get triggered. This automation sits in different places for each platform.

> Files in the source folder and destination folder should have the **same name** to avoid duplication.
